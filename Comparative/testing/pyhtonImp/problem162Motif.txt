The problem is asking for the number of hexadecimal numbers of up to 16 digits that contain at least one of the digits 0, 1, and A.

A hexadecimal number is a number in base 16, which means it uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F. Therefore, there are 16^n possible n-digit hexadecimal numbers.

The strategy to solve this problem is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which states that for any two sets A and B, the size of their union is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. 
This principle can be extended to three sets A, B, and C: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

The sets in this problem are the set of hexadecimal numbers that lack the digit 0 (A), the digit 1 (B), or the digit A (C).

The total number of n-digit hexadecimal numbers is 16^n. The number of n-digit hexadecimal numbers without a 0 (set A) is 15^n, because we have 15 symbols to choose from. 
The same applies for sets B and C. The number of n-digit hexadecimal numbers without a 0 and 1 (set A ∩ B) is 14^n, because we have 14 symbols to choose from. 
The same applies for sets A ∩ C and B ∩ C. The number of n-digit hexadecimal numbers without a 0, 1, and A (set A ∩ B ∩ C) is 13^n, because we have 13 symbols to choose from.

Therefore, the total number of hexadecimal numbers with at least one 0, 1, or A is given by:
